The transcript does not provide the revenue for TSMC in US dollar terms in 2019.,"Jan 13, 2022, 1:00 a.m. ET","and for our industry-leading advanced and specialty technologies, where we see strong interest from all four growth platforms, which are smartphone, HPC, IoT, and automotive. Entering 2022, we expect the supply chain to maintain a higher level of inventory as compared to the historical seasonal level given the industry's continued need to ensure supply security.
While the short-term imbalance may or may not persist, we continue to observe the structural increase in long-term semiconductor demand underpinned by the industry mega trend of 5G and HPC-related applications. We also observed the higher silicon content in many end devices, including automotive, PCs, servers, networking, and smartphones. As a result, we expect our capacity to remain tight throughout 2022 as we believe our technology leadership will enable TSMC to capture the strong demand for our advanced and specialty technologies. Next, let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook and profitability.
We are entering a period of higher structural growth. As the technology becomes more pervasive and essential in people's lives, and the digital transformation accelerates, the semiconductor industry value in supply chain is increasing. As we embark upon the 5G era, an intelligent and more connected world will fuel a massive requirement for computation power and prepare greater need for energy-efficient computing, which demand greater use of leading-edge technologies. The multiyear mega trend of 5G and HPC-related applications will drive multiunit volume growth and more importantly, spur substantial semiconductor content enrichment in HPC, smartphone, automotive, and IoT applications to address the structural increase in the long-term market demand profile.
TSMC is working closely with our customers to plan our capacity and investing in leading-edge and specialty technology to support their group demand. At the same time, we are committed to achieve a sustainable and proper return that enable us to invest to support our customers' growth and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. Over the last three years, we have raised our capex spending from USD 14.9 billion in 2019 to USD 30 billion in 2021 as we invest in anticipation of the growth that will follow. During the same period, our revenue in US dollar term has increased from USD 34.6 billion in 2019 to USD 56.8 billion in 2021 or 1.6 times and our EPS by 1.7 times.
Looking ahead, as the world's largest reliable and effective capacity provider with our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customer trust, we are well-positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry mega trend with our differentiated technologies. We expect our long-term revenue to be between 15% and 20% CAGR over the next several years in US dollar terms, of course, fueled by all four growth platform which are smartphone, HPC, IoT, and automotive. With the increasing need for computation, HPC will be the strongest driver of TSMC's long-term growth and expect it to be the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth with the CPU, GPU, and AI accelerators are the main growth area for our HPC platform. As we invest in leading-edge and specialty technology to support our customers' demand, we continue to face manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading-edge node, new investment in mature node, expansion of our global manufacturing footprint, and rising materials and basic commodity cost.
We are continuing to work closely with our customer to support their growth, and our pricing strategy will remain strategic not optimistic to reflect our value creation. We will also work diligently in our own fab operation and with our suppliers to deliver on cost improvement. By taking such actions, we believe our long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable, and we can earn a sustainable and proper return of greater than 25% ROE through that cycle.

What is the expected growth rate of global smartphone units in 2021 , The expected growth rate of global smartphone units in 2021 is 10%.,"Jan 14, 2021, 1:00 a.m. ET","g demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. We expect global smartphone units to grow 10% year-over-year in 2021. We forecast the penetration rate for 5G smartphone of the total smartphone market to rise from 18% in 2020 to more than 35% in 2021.
We expect the silicon content of a 5G smartphone to continue to increase as compared to a 4G smartphone. We continue to expect faster penetration of 5G smartphone as compared to 4G over the next several years as 5G smartphone benefit from the significant performance and with a latency improvement of 5G network to drive more AI applications and more cloud services. We believe 5G is a multi-year megatrend that will enable a world where digital computation is increasingly ubiquitous, which will fuel the growth of all four of our growth platforms in the next several years.
As we enter the 5G era, a smarter and more intelligent world will require massive increases in computation power and greater need for energy-efficient computing, and therefore, require leading-edge technologies. Thus, HPC is an increasingly important driver of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth. With our technology leadership, we are well positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend. We now expect our long-term revenue growth to be 10% to 15% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 in US dollar terms.
Now, I will talk about the N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with up to 70% logic density gain, up to 15% performance gain and up to 30% power reduction as compared with 5-nanometer. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We are seeing a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone application at N3 as compared with N5 and N7 at a similar stage. Risk production is scheduled in 2021 and volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident our 3-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, I will talk about TSMC's 3D fabric. TSMC has developed an industry-leading and comprehensive wafer-level 3DIC technology roadmap to enhance system-level performance. Our differentiated chiplet and heterogeneous integration technologies drive better power efficiency, as smaller form factor benefit for our customer, while shortening their time to market. This technology, including CHIPS stake in solution, such as SoIC, as well as our advanced packaging solutions, such as InFO and CoWoS. We observe chiplets are becoming an industry trend. We are working with several customers on 3D fabric to enable chiplet architecture. SoIC's full volume production is targeted in 2022. SoIC is expected to be first adopted by HPC applications, where bandwidth performance, power efficiency and form factor are aggressively pursued. We expect revenue from our back-end services, which include InFO's advanced packaging and testing to grow at a rate higher than corporate average in the next few years.

We are working with several customers on 3D fabric to enable chiplet architecture. SoIC's full volume production is targeted in 2022. SoIC is expected to be first adopted by HPC applications, where bandwidth performance, power efficiency and form factor are aggressively pursued. We expect revenue from our back-end services, which include InFO's advanced packaging and testing to grow at a rate higher than corporate average in the next few years.

What is TSMC's expected revenue growth rate in U.S. dollar terms over the next several years , The expected revenue growth rate for TSMC over the next several years is between 15% and 20% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms.,"Jul 14, 2022, 2:00 a.m. ET","ferentiating factors, we expect our capacity utilization to remain healthy in 2023. And our business to be less volatile, they're more resilient, supported by the strong demand for our differentiated and leading advanced and specialty technologies.
Now let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. While macroeconomic headwinds bring near-term uncertainties that may persist, we believe the fundamental structural growth trajectory in the long-term semiconductor demand remains firmly in place. We continue to observe silicon content increase across many end devices, fueled by process technology migration and increased functionality. For example, the number of CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators in the data center are increasing.
5G smartphone carries substantially higher silicon content as compared to 4G smartphone. The amount of silicon content in today's car continue to rise. While the device unit growth of many electronics device may be flattish to low single-digit percentage range, in the next several years, the silicon content growth will be higher, in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range and support the long-term structural semiconductor demand and increase our addressable wafer demand. TSMC's capex and capacity planning are always based on the long-term structural market demand profile, not near-term factors.
We are working closely with our customer to plan our long-term capacity and investing in leading edge and specialty technology to support their growth. We will manage our business prudently through the near-term uncertainties, and we remain highly confident in our long-term growth outlook. With our technology leadership, manufacturing and capacity support and customers trust, TSMC is well positioned to capture the strong multiyear growth from the favorable structural megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. We reiterate our long-term revenue to be between 15 and 20 CAGR over the next several years in U.S.
dollar terms. Next, let me talk about the tool delivery update. As a major player in the global semiconductor supply chain, TSMC work closely with all our tool supplier to plan our capex and capacity in advance. However, like many other industries, our suppliers have been facing greater challenges in their supply chains, which are extending toward delivery lead times for both advanced and mature nodes.
As a result, we expect some of our capex this year to be pushed out into 2023. TSMC is actively doing its part to help our tool suppliers address the supply chain challenges. In April, we said that we have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress and send several teams on site to support our suppliers. Since then, we have worked closely to identify critical chips that are gauging toward delivery.
We are working dynamically with our customers and prioritize our wafer capacity to support these critical chips to help mitigate the chip constant issues. While challenges remain, the situation is improving. We do not expect any impact to our 2022 capacity plan. And we are able to put in the delivery schedule for certain amount of tools for our 2023 capacity.
We have been working closely with our customer for 2023 so that we can support their demand. Now let me talk about the N3 and N3 status. Our N3 is on track for volume production in second half of this year with Goodyear. We expect revenue contribution starting first half of 2023, with a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications.
N3 will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance, power and yield. N3 will offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. We observed a high level of customer engagement at N3. And volume production is scheduled for around one year after N3.
Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced.

With our technology leadership, manufacturing and capacity support and customers trust, TSMC is well positioned to capture the strong multiyear growth from the favorable structural megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. We reiterate our long-term revenue to be between 15 and 20 CAGR over the next several years in U.S.
dollar terms. Next, let me talk about the tool delivery update. As a major player in the global semiconductor supply chain, TSMC work closely with all our tool supplier to plan our capex and capacity in advance. However, like many other industries, our suppliers have been facing greater challenges in their supply chains, which are extending toward delivery lead times for both advanced and mature nodes.
As a result, we expect some of our capex this year to be pushed out into 2023. TSMC is actively doing its part to help our tool suppliers address the supply chain challenges. In April, we said that we have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress and send several teams on site to support our suppliers. Since then, we have worked closely to identify critical chips that are gauging toward delivery.
We are working dynamically with our customers and prioritize our wafer capacity to support these critical chips to help mitigate the chip constant issues. While challenges remain, the situation is improving. We do not expect any impact to our 2022 capacity plan. And we are able to put in the delivery schedule for certain amount of tools for our 2023 capacity.
We have been working closely with our customer for 2023 so that we can support their demand. Now let me talk about the N3 and N3 status. Our N3 is on track for volume production in second half of this year with Goodyear. We expect revenue contribution starting first half of 2023, with a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications.
N3 will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance, power and yield. N3 will offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. We observed a high level of customer engagement at N3. And volume production is scheduled for around one year after N3.
Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident that our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.

What is the estimated growth rate for the foundry industry in 2022 according to UMC's management , The estimated growth rate for the foundry industry in 2022 according to UMC's management is 12%.,"Oct 27, 2021, 5:00 a.m. ET"," we foresee those structural catalysts will continue to drive, including the 5G transformation, the EV and IoT devices.

Okay. And lastly, variable cost. I mean that is a key reason why foundry peers want to hike the price, right? So variable cost no matter percentage or per wafer number. So can Chitung give us some kind of comment about the trend? For example, this year-over-year, what was the growth for the variable cost? And what would be the variable cost growth for the coming two years?
Qi Dong Liu -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Governance and Company Secretary
Yes. For the operating expenses, it will be growing along with our enlarged revenue. However, as a percentage of revenue, we hope it will be flat to down, under control. So the revenue growth will outpace the operating expenses. As for raw material like raw wafer and also labors that were also on the rise. But altogether, I think we are commenting that because of our production efficiency improvement, our improved economy of scale, and also with a good outlook for both demand as well as pricing for 2022.

Good afternoon. So your Xiamen fab began production from 4Q 2015. It was still loss-making last year, and I think it is still loss-making now.

Looking more broadly at 2020, we see demand for 5G-enabled devices and high-performance computing sparking a broader recovery in the market. Gartner forecasts that worldwide, mobile phones will see a modest increase this year versus a decline in 2019. Driving the majority of that increase are the 5G-enabled handsets, which Gartner predicts will account for 12% of all mobile phone shipments in 2020, increasing to 43% of all mobile phones in 2022. As a result, we expect to see a number of Onto Innovation markets expand in 2020.
The most obvious impact of this growth is in our specialty devices and advanced packaging segment. Underscoring this opportunity is our release from earlier in this -- in the month announcing the receipt of orders for 15 inspection systems from two customers rapidly expanding advanced packaging capacity to support wafer-level packaging of 5G devices. We see continued growth in these markets in 2020, driven by volume increases as well as additional devices migrating to advanced packaging. We also see 5G and high-performance computing, benefiting our advanced node segments in which leaders, such as SK Hynix, recently forecast 5G smartphones will drive a 25% increase in DRAM content per phone, while NAND will benefit from 20% increase per phone.
And TSMC recently cited growing demand for their 5 nanometer process from 5G processors, RF front-end modules and advanced computing. We expect our advanced semiconductor nodes segment to grow modestly with sustained levels of logic foundry spending and a pickup in memory spending starting with DRAM. In conclusion, semiconductor markets are becoming more diverse every year. We see chip innovations and cameras, sensing and communications, enabling new customer products such as smart home, smart grids and wearable health monitors.
We see innovations in the advanced nodes for both memory and logic, enabling data centers and AI engines to open up entirely new markets such as medicine, autonomous driving and energy. We see a growing number of customers increasing their focus on advanced packaging technology to unlock the full potential of new chip designs and more tightly integrated and high-performing form factors. Across the spectrum, Onto Innovation is an important partner to our customers. Our merger strengthens our ability to provide value-enhancing services to our customers, increase our pace of product innovation and deliver more comprehensive, integrated solutions to challenges further down our customers road map.

In addition, as detailed in our last conference call, Rudolph was deemed the financial acquirer in the merger.
And therefore, the combined financial results presented today represent the results of Rudolph for the full fourth quarter but only the results of former Nanometrics since the closing of the merger on October 25. I recognize that this partial quarter makes comparability of prior period somewhat difficult and I'll try to bridge those differences for comparative purposes to the prior periods.

I recognize that this partial quarter makes comparability of prior period somewhat difficult and I'll try to bridge those differences for comparative purposes to the prior periods. As Mike mentioned, our reported fourth-quarter revenue was $120.6 million, above the midpoint of our guidance. That revenue excludes both $10 million of Nanometrics October shipments and $1.7 million of deferred revenue that would have rolled into the quarter but was eliminated in the merger accounting.

What was the revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 for the specialty devices and advanced packaging segment of the merged company ONTO, The revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 for the specialty devices and advanced packaging segment of the merged company ONTO was $10 million.,"Feb 06, 2020, 4:30 p.m. ET","nts. And as we manage through this situation and assess timing, our first priority will be to the safety and well-being of our staff and their families.
Looking more broadly at 2020, we see demand for 5G-enabled devices and high-performance computing sparking a broader recovery in the market. Gartner forecasts that worldwide, mobile phones will see a modest increase this year versus a decline in 2019. Driving the majority of that increase are the 5G-enabled handsets, which Gartner predicts will account for 12% of all mobile phone shipments in 2020, increasing to 43% of all mobile phones in 2022. As a result, we expect to see a number of Onto Innovation markets expand in 2020.
The most obvious impact of this growth is in our specialty devices and advanced packaging segment. Underscoring this opportunity is our release from earlier in this -- in the month announcing the receipt of orders for 15 inspection systems from two customers rapidly expanding advanced packaging capacity to support wafer-level packaging of 5G devices. We see continued growth in these markets in 2020, driven by volume increases as well as additional devices migrating to advanced packaging. We also see 5G and high-performance computing, benefiting our advanced node segments in which leaders, such as SK Hynix, recently forecast 5G smartphones will drive a 25% increase in DRAM content per phone, while NAND will benefit from 20% increase per phone.
And TSMC recently cited growing demand for their 5 nanometer process from 5G processors, RF front-end modules and advanced computing. We expect our advanced semiconductor nodes segment to grow modestly with sustained levels of logic foundry spending and a pickup in memory spending starting with DRAM. In conclusion, semiconductor markets are becoming more diverse every year. We see chip innovations and cameras, sensing and communications, enabling new customer products such as smart home, smart grids and wearable health monitors.
We see innovations in the advanced nodes for both memory and logic, enabling data centers and AI engines to open up entirely new markets such as medicine, autonomous driving and energy. We see a growing number of customers increasing their focus on advanced packaging technology to unlock the full potential of new chip designs and more tightly integrated and high-performing form factors. Across the spectrum, Onto Innovation is an important partner to our customers. Our merger strengthens our ability to provide value-enhancing services to our customers, increase our pace of product innovation and deliver more comprehensive, integrated solutions to challenges further down our customers road map.
We are only at the very start of this journey but we are committed to maximizing our potential to the benefit of all of our stakeholders, customers, shareholders and our team. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Roth to review the financial highlights.
Steven Roth -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks Mike. Before I begin my financial remarks today, I want to remind you as usual the financial results discussed here will be provided on a non-GAAP basis. And that our non-GAAP presentation for the new merged company no longer excludes stock-based compensation as the former Rudolph financials did. In addition, as detailed in our last conference call, Rudolph was deemed the financial acquirer in the merger.

What is the expected contribution of N5 to TSMC's wafer revenue in 2021 , The expected contribution of N5 to TSMC's wafer revenue in 2021 is around 20%.,"Apr 15, 2021, 2:00 a.m. ET"," water shortage at different stages. We will continue our collaborative effort with the government and the private sector and water conservation, and new water sources. We saw a comprehensive enterprise risk management system. We do not expect to see any material impact to our operations.
Finally, I will talk about N5 and industry status. TSMC's N5 is foundry industry's most advanced solution, with the best of PPA. N5 is already in the second year of volume production, with yield better than our original plan. N5 demand continued to be strong, driven by smartphone and HPC applications, and we expect N5 to contribute around 20% of our wafer revenue in 2021. N4 leveraged the strong foundation of N5, to further extend our 5-nanometer family. N4 is a straightforward migration from N5, with compatible design rules, while providing further performance, power and density enhancement for the next wave of 5-nanometer products. N4's production is targeted for second half this year, and volume production in 2022. Thus we expect demand for our N5 family to continue to grow in the next several years, driven by the robust demand for smartphone and HPC applications.
N3 we will be another four node stride from our N5, and will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance, and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We continue to see a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone applications at N3, as compared with the N5 and N3 at a similar stage.
Risk production is scheduled in 2021. The volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology, when it is introduced. Thus we are confident, that both our 5-nanometer and 3 nanometer will be large and long lasting nodes for TSMC.

Finally, let me talk about our mature node capacity strategy. TSMC's strategy at a mature node is to work closely with our customers to develop a specialty technology solutions to meet customers' requirement and create differentiated and long-lasting value to customers.
We expect the multiyear industry makeup trend of 5G and HPC and the higher silicon content in many end devices, to drive increasing demand and mature node for certain specialty technologies. We forecast 28-nanometer will be the sweet spot for our embedded memory applications and our long-term structural demand at 28-nanometer to be supported by multiple specialty technologies. In support of our specialty technology strategies, we are expanding our 28-nanometer manufacturing capacity and size in China, Japan, and Taiwan. Our capacity expansion is based on customers' need, business opportunities, operating efficiency, and cost economic considerations.
We believe the expansion of our mature node capacity will enable us to better serve our customers' needs and reach global talents, and our differentiated specialty technology will enable us to capture the demand generated from the industry mega trend and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.

Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
OK. Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on the results and the outlook and margins.
First question on the growth outlook. When we compare the growth expectation mid- to high 20% versus if I roll up the fabless and IDM customers, they're about mid-teens growth. So your outgrowth looks much wider than most peers. Could you break it down a bit more, the factors between share gain, pricing moves? And also if there's any component of inventory build in there?
Jeff Su
OK. Randy, let me summarize your first question. I believe your question is referring to the 2022 growth outlook. And Randy --
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
That's right.
Jeff Su
Right. And so Randy is saying, TSMC's guidance of mid- to high 20s percentage, his calculation show that the fabless industry is growing maybe around mid-teens. So we will outgrow the foundry -- sorry, the fabless. And so he is wondering what is driving this outgrowth.
Is it share gain? Pricing? Are there other factors, such as inventory build, into this? And if we can share.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
OK. Let me answer the question. This is C.C. Wei.
Actually, the growth in 2022 is all the above you just mentioned. It's a share gain, it's the pricing and also its a unit growth. Did I answer your question?
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Yes, mostly. And maybe just a quick -- two quick follow-ups to that. If you could break the growth by platform and if you could indicate just how much -- like how much do you think your customers want to put in place for inventory? Like how big a component do you think that factor is?
Jeff Su
OK. So Randy's follow-up is, can we give our 2022 growth by platform outlook? And then how much of a role is inventory build plan in this growth?

The first to ask questions, Randy Abrams from Credit Suisse.
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
OK. Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on the results and the outlook and margins.
First question on the growth outlook. When we compare the growth expectation mid- to high 20% versus if I roll up the fabless and IDM customers, they're about mid-teens growth. So your outgrowth looks much wider than most peers. Could you break it down a bit more, the factors between share gain, pricing moves? And also if there's any component of inventory build in there?
Jeff Su
OK. Randy, let me summarize your first question. I believe your question is referring to the 2022 growth outlook. And Randy --
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
That's right.
Jeff Su
Right. And so Randy is saying, TSMC's guidance of mid- to high 20s percentage, his calculation show that the fabless industry is growing maybe around mid-teens. So we will outgrow the foundry -- sorry, the fabless. And so he is wondering what is driving this outgrowth.
Is it share gain? Pricing? Are there other factors, such as inventory build, into this? And if we can share.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
OK. Let me answer the question. This is C.C. Wei.
Actually, the growth in 2022 is all the above you just mentioned. It's a share gain, it's the pricing and also its a unit growth. Did I answer your question?
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Yes, mostly. And maybe just a quick -- two quick follow-ups to that. If you could break the growth by platform and if you could indicate just how much -- like how much do you think your customers want to put in place for inventory? Like how big a component do you think that factor is?
Jeff Su
OK. So Randy's follow-up is, can we give our 2022 growth by platform outlook? And then how much of a role is inventory build plan in this growth?

What is TSMC's expected full-year growth in U.S. dollar terms for 2022 , TSMC's expected full-year growth in U.S. dollar terms for 2022 is mid-30%.,"Jul 14, 2022, 2:00 a.m. ET","se areas.
Despite the ongoing inventory correction, our customers' demand continue to exceed our ability to supply. We expect our capacity to remain tight throughout 2022 and our full-year growth to be mid-30% in U.S. dollar terms. Three key factor in supporting TSMC's strong structural demand are our technology leadership and differentiation, our strong portfolio in high-performance computing and our strategic relationship with customers.
All of these factors are TSMC's strength in the foundry industry. First, on technology leadership and differentiation, TSMC's technology position is much stronger today as compared to previous years. Looking ahead to 2023, we are working diligently to provide the industry most advanced technologies and making it available to all the product innovators with the successful ramp of N5, N4P, N4X, and the upcoming ramp up of N3, we will expand our customer product portfolio and increase our addressable market. The macroeconomic uncertainty may persist into 2023.
Our technology leadership will continue to advance and support our growth. Secondly, the massive structural increase in the demand of computation, underpinned by the industry megatrend, continues to fill greater need for performance and energy-efficient computing, which require use of leading-edge technologies. Through our comprehensive IP ecosystem and optimized process technology, we are able to address and capture the structural demand and build a strong portfolio in high-performance computing. We expect HPC to be the main engine of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth in the next several years.
Third, our strategic relationship with our customers are long term in nature, developed and built through many years of collaboration and investment to enable customers' success in the high-end market. We continue to work closely with our customer and technology development, capacity planning and pricing to support their long-term demand and growth. With all these three differentiating factors, we expect our capacity utilization to remain healthy in 2023. And our business to be less volatile, they're more resilient, supported by the strong demand for our differentiated and leading advanced and specialty technologies.
Now let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. While macroeconomic headwinds bring near-term uncertainties that may persist, we believe the fundamental structural growth trajectory in the long-term semiconductor demand remains firmly in place. We continue to observe silicon content increase across many end devices, fueled by process technology migration and increased functionality. For example, the number of CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators in the data center are increasing.
5G smartphone carries substantially higher silicon content as compared to 4G smartphone. The amount of silicon content in today's car continue to rise. While the device unit growth of many electronics device may be flattish to low single-digit percentage range, in the next several years, the silicon content growth will be higher, in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range and support the long-term structural semiconductor demand and increase our addressable wafer demand. TSMC's capex and capacity planning are always based on the long-term structural market demand profile, not near-term factors.
We are working closely with our customer to plan our long-term capacity and investing in leading edge and specialty technology to support their growth. We will manage our business prudently through the near-term uncertainties, and we remain highly confident in our long-term growth outlook. With our technology leadership, manufacturing and capacity support and customers trust, TSMC is well positioned to capture the strong multiyear growth from the favorable structural megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders.

Now let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. While macroeconomic headwinds bring near-term uncertainties that may persist, we believe the fundamental structural growth trajectory in the long-term semiconductor demand remains firmly in place. We continue to observe silicon content increase across many end devices, fueled by process technology migration and increased functionality. For example, the number of CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators in the data center are increasing.
5G smartphone carries substantially higher silicon content as compared to 4G smartphone. The amount of silicon content in today's car continue to rise. While the device unit growth of many electronics device may be flattish to low single-digit percentage range, in the next several years, the silicon content growth will be higher, in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range and support the long-term structural semiconductor demand and increase our addressable wafer demand. TSMC's capex and capacity planning are always based on the long-term structural market demand profile, not near-term factors.
We are working closely with our customer to plan our long-term capacity and investing in leading edge and specialty technology to support their growth. We will manage our business prudently through the near-term uncertainties, and we remain highly confident in our long-term growth outlook. With our technology leadership, manufacturing and capacity support and customers trust, TSMC is well positioned to capture the strong multiyear growth from the favorable structural megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders.

What was the revenue generated by the company in the fourth quarter of 2020 ," The revenue generated by the company in the fourth quarter of 2020 was not explicitly stated in the transcript.

In the fabless foundry ecosystem, a couple of mobile and a couple of high-performance compute designs, the mobile designs for sure associated with 5G that ramped hard. We just see those that specific concentration of designs, not necessarily happening in the first quarter. I mean, our guidance is obviously not down by a huge amount. And so you can see there is still significant strength there.
Longer term, as we look through 2021 and next couple of years toward target model, growth in foundry and logic probe cards is one of the fundamental underlying drivers of our path toward that model and 5G is a huge part of it. So, by no means is the 5G ramp over. We just had a bunch of design stack up that we had to deliver in the fourth quarter that lead to the all-time record quarterly revenues.
Tyler Burmeister -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
Makes sense. Perfect. Understood. And thank you for clarifying to comment on site. And second question then moving on to the DRAM probe card side, strong end of the year after couple of quarters of more digested in the beginning of 2020. You said you expect that kind of flat Q1 maybe even still in the first half. So, I was wondering could we expect kind of $35 million, $40 million levels sort of baseline for that business, or over time can we get back to be above $40 million a quarter like we saw a couple of years ago?
Mike Slessor -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. The way we think about DRAM and obviously being a supplier in the DRAM supply chain value chain, you have to be prepared to deal with cyclicality, at least on a quarterly basis. We saw that as you noted in 2020, right. We went from what was a multi-year high in Q4 of '19 at about $40 million in DRAM revenues down to $20 million in next quarter. That's a pretty extreme swing. But I think it does represent the bands in which that business should be expected to operate in any given quarter. 2021 though does seem to be a pretty decent year for the overall DRAM supply chain. There's going to be investments in capacity. As we told you we see strong design pipelines from our customers that are feeding our business. I think though that a reasonable expectation in any given quarter is probably a $30 million maybe low $30 millions kind of run rate for DRAM with some unusual swings up and down as different design release cadences either are additive or substractive with each other. So, think about it in $35 million probably the high-end of what I want to give you for an average level, but certainly starts with the three.

Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, maybe another geographic question for you, when you look at Taiwan, it was about 25% of the business, but I was surprised to see that TSMC was not a 10% customer, so maybe just talk a little bit about the dynamics in Taiwan.
Mike Slessor -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Well, there's a lot of action in Taiwan, right. We have one of our large memory customers, has a large production and test facility there, a lot of the outsourced assembly and test capacity of the world is in there. So, Taiwan revenue is not necessarily the world's largest foundry. But with them, they were a 10% customer in the third quarter. They were close to a 10% customer, again at the record revenue levels of the fourth quarter. And given the continued momentum we have in delivering into their advanced nodes. As a reminder, this is for us a 10 nanometer, 7 nanometer, 5-nanometer kind of business, but we're doing a nice job, I think, of broadening that business.

What is the expected revenue for the DRAM probe card business in the first quarter of 2021 , The expected revenue for the DRAM probe card business in the first quarter of 2021 is $30 million to $35 million.,"Feb 3, 2021, 4:25 p.m. ET"," the fourth quarter.
In the fabless foundry ecosystem, a couple of mobile and a couple of high-performance compute designs, the mobile designs for sure associated with 5G that ramped hard. We just see those that specific concentration of designs, not necessarily happening in the first quarter. I mean, our guidance is obviously not down by a huge amount. And so you can see there is still significant strength there.
Longer term, as we look through 2021 and next couple of years toward target model, growth in foundry and logic probe cards is one of the fundamental underlying drivers of our path toward that model and 5G is a huge part of it. So, by no means is the 5G ramp over. We just had a bunch of design stack up that we had to deliver in the fourth quarter that lead to the all-time record quarterly revenues.
Tyler Burmeister -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
Makes sense. Perfect. Understood. And thank you for clarifying to comment on site. And second question then moving on to the DRAM probe card side, strong end of the year after couple of quarters of more digested in the beginning of 2020. You said you expect that kind of flat Q1 maybe even still in the first half. So, I was wondering could we expect kind of $35 million, $40 million levels sort of baseline for that business, or over time can we get back to be above $40 million a quarter like we saw a couple of years ago?
Mike Slessor -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. The way we think about DRAM and obviously being a supplier in the DRAM supply chain value chain, you have to be prepared to deal with cyclicality, at least on a quarterly basis. We saw that as you noted in 2020, right. We went from what was a multi-year high in Q4 of '19 at about $40 million in DRAM revenues down to $20 million in next quarter. That's a pretty extreme swing. But I think it does represent the bands in which that business should be expected to operate in any given quarter. 2021 though does seem to be a pretty decent year for the overall DRAM supply chain. There's going to be investments in capacity. As we told you we see strong design pipelines from our customers that are feeding our business. I think though that a reasonable expectation in any given quarter is probably a $30 million maybe low $30 millions kind of run rate for DRAM with some unusual swings up and down as different design release cadences either are additive or substractive with each other. So, think about it in $35 million probably the high-end of what I want to give you for an average level, but certainly starts with the three.

What is the expected growth rate of 200-millimeter fab capacity in the semiconductor industry in 2022 , The expected growth rate of 200-millimeter fab capacity in the semiconductor industry in 2022 is 21%.,"Apr 27, 2022, 5:00 p.m. ET","ur MST SP technology to a very prestigious IEEE power conference.
The ISPSD Conference is the premier international forum for technical discussions on all aspects of power devices. Although thousands of papers were submitted, ours was one of only a few selected for the conference in May. There is no doubt that our submission will expand interest in MST SP for the key players in the power semiconductor industry, who we know will attend this important conference in May. Our work on RF-SOI technology, which is critically important to 5G cellular, continues to consume a lot of our time and resources because of its great commercial potential.
We hope this area will be one of the earliest to adopt MST and to bring it to production considering the significant improvements we can bring to designs. Likewise, we continue to believe our technology has excellent potential in memory and for advanced nodes. Now I'd like to address some recent developments in the semiconductor industry, which I believe create an exceptionally favorable environment for Atomera. Well, the big headlines tend to focus on how TSMC, Samsung, and Intel are competing to bring the three-nanometer or two-nanometer nodes to market.
The industry has recently been recognizing the importance of the legacy nodes and of particular fabs running 200-millimeter wafers. Given the chip supply shortfalls, it seems obvious that the industry needs to add capacity in this area, and 200-millimeter fab capacity is forecast to grow 21% to mitigate the supply imbalance. There are a few problems. First, the vast majority of 200-millimeter lines have been operating in fully depreciated fabs, which can be very attractive financially when operated near capacity limits.
Building new fabs is very expensive and 200-millimeter equipment, which has had very limited production over the last decade, is in short supply and is priced at a premium. This situation will place substantial margin pressure on these companies for many years until they can defray the very expensive build costs. So these new fabs can't easily get equipment, and when they can, the associated capex costs will drive lower profitability than they've experienced in the past. MST can help solve these problems for both the fab owners and their fabless customers by allowing them to shrink die and thus boost throughput with only a minor increase in tool costs.
200-millimeter EPI tools are available and MST will allow operators to continue utilizing their depreciated fabs with the associated good economics. Foundry capacity is forecast to stay tight, while industrywide capex is forecast to grow by 24% in 2022, primarily in 300-millimeter wafer fabs. Deal with the capacity crunch and pay for the capex, fabs are raising prices on their wafers up to 20% now. Industry insiders say that price rises are not transitory.
They are permanent. This situation, as fabless semiconductor makers will tell, the need to get more die per wafer is imperative. MST provides a path to get to these improvements that is both easily implementable and at a more reasonable price than most other alternatives. Atomera is spreading this message to industry players, and we believe that it will lead to widespread adoption over time.
We remain laser focused on getting the first player into production, which we believe will drive the domino effect that's been predicted for some time. As I've said in the past, we believe industry conditions have reached a point where both near- and long-term structural changes will provide exceptional opportunities for Atomera. In our Q4 call, I said that we were entering into 2022 with strong momentum, and I think you will agree that it has continued with a new licensee, successful execution on our first JDA and the opening of a new JDA. On the technical development side, we also continue to make good progress as recognized important third parties in the industry.

What is the expected production schedule for N4X , The expected production schedule for N4X is in the first half of 2023.,"Jan 13, 2022, 1:00 a.m. ET","support our customers' growth and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.
Now I will talk about N5 and N4P and N4X status. As our N5 enter its third year of ramp, demand continues to be very strong, driven by smartphone and HPC applications. Our N5 has proven to be the industry's most competitive leading-edge technology. To further enhance our N5 family's performance, power, and density improvement for next-wave 5-nanometer products, we also introduced the N4P and N4X technologies.
N4P offers 11% performance boost as compared to the N5 with 22% improvement in power efficiency and 6% density gain. N4P is designed for easy migration from N5 with its products taking our schedule for second half 2022. We also introduced N4X as an offering especially optimized for workload-intensive HPC applications. N4X will offer much more circuit performance boost over N5 and we expect it to enter its production in first half 2023.
With our continuous enhancement of our N5 process technologies, we expect demand for our N5 family to continue to grow in the next several years, and for N5 family to be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Next, let me talk about the N3 and N3E status, our N3 technology wide-use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track. We have developed complete performance support for both HPC and the smartphone applications.
N3 production will start in second half of 2022. We continue to see a high level of customer engagement at N3, and expect the more new tape-outs for N3 for the fourth year as compared with N5. N3E will further extend our N3E family with the enhanced performance, power, and yield. We also observed a high level of customer engagement at N3E, and volume production is scheduled for one year after N3.
Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. With our technology leadership and strong customer demand, we are confident that our N3E family will be another large and long-last node for TSMC. Finally, let me talk about our mature node capacity strategy. TSMC's strategy at a mature node is to work closely with our customers to develop a specialty technology solutions to meet customers' requirement and create differentiated and long-lasting value to customers.
We expect the multiyear industry makeup trend of 5G and HPC and the higher silicon content in many end devices, to drive increasing demand and mature node for certain specialty technologies. We forecast 28-nanometer will be the sweet spot for our embedded memory applications and our long-term structural demand at 28-nanometer to be supported by multiple specialty technologies. In support of our specialty technology strategies, we are expanding our 28-nanometer manufacturing capacity and size in China, Japan, and Taiwan. Our capacity expansion is based on customers' need, business opportunities, operating efficiency, and cost economic considerations.
We believe the expansion of our mature node capacity will enable us to better serve our customers' needs and reach global talents, and our differentiated specialty technology will enable us to capture the demand generated from the industry mega trend and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.

So John, just kind of commenting briefly on the level of activity we are seeing because that, in many ways, is that leading indicator. So we're seeing proposal activity increasing. We're seeing that increasing in the U.S. We're seeing it increasing across Asia. I think about China, South Korea, India, a couple of the ASEAN markets as well. So we're seeing a lot more projects. Now, a part of these projects are electronics. You've heard me talk about electronics before, what a strong growth we've seen in the quarter. And my expectation is that we will see a lot more of electronic project growth happen as we see these new fab buildups happen as well. They are progressing well. They are all on track, and you've seen a number of announcements, I'm sure, from TSMC, Samsung, Intel and so on and so forth. So those are all looking to be on track and part of that activity.

Peter Clark -- Societe Generale -- Analyst
Yes. Good afternoon everyone. I've got two questions. First one for Sanjiv, I think. About the productivity being embedded, obviously, in the PLC. Is the story now on productivity more about not adding costs back if the volumes continue to grow rather than savage cost cutting as such? Because I did notice, obviously, Q4 -- we'll get the Q1 numbers later in terms of the headcount and the severance costs. But they did slow, obviously, in the fourth quarter from the pace earlier in the year. And then for Matt, on the cash flow, I mean, the Q1 performance now is what we would normally see in the legacy companies, usually in Q4, which is normally the strongest quarter. I'm just wondering how that progresses through the year, given that you always make more money in the second half? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer
Peter, thanks. I'm going to give you a quick view on productivity. So you've heard me say this before, and I think Matt kind of made a very good observation earlier on, which is that we are always going to be very, very focused on managing our cost base. Our total cash fixed cost is something we kind of discuss every month at the business reviews that we carry out. So adding cost back is something we kind of manage actively. I think it doesn't necessarily translate into productivity because for productivity, we want to see that incremental action as well, which makes it tough. But it is in the DNA of the organization, Peter, and you've heard me talk kind of passionately about the fact that every individual in our organization has got a mandate to go out and look for productivity every day.
It's thousands of projects, which add small benefits but actually flow into the entire productivity part that we put together. There's one other thing which I think is now enabling that or helping us accelerate that, and that's around digitalization. And again, hopefully, you've heard me speak about this as well before. We're using digitalization, not as a significant tool that's going to create Earth-shattering new discoveries for us, but it's something that we apply in our business to deal with pain points every day.

He also mentions that they are seeing a lot more electronic project growth as new fab buildups progress well and are on track. Additionally, he mentions that they are seeing more traditional markets, such as steel, chemicals, refining, and project activity picking up.","May 6, 2021, 10:00 a.m. ET","fficer
So John, just kind of commenting briefly on the level of activity we are seeing because that, in many ways, is that leading indicator. So we're seeing proposal activity increasing. We're seeing that increasing in the U.S. We're seeing it increasing across Asia. I think about China, South Korea, India, a couple of the ASEAN markets as well. So we're seeing a lot more projects. Now, a part of these projects are electronics. You've heard me talk about electronics before, what a strong growth we've seen in the quarter. And my expectation is that we will see a lot more of electronic project growth happen as we see these new fab buildups happen as well. They are progressing well. They are all on track, and you've seen a number of announcements, I'm sure, from TSMC, Samsung, Intel and so on and so forth. So those are all looking to be on track and part of that activity. I also have to say that the other piece I'm a little more -- I'm a little more positive on is the more traditional markets, steel, chemicals, refining, also project activity actually picking up over there as we see. So I'm not going to comment particularly on if we are seeing potentially this as a snapback. I see this as fundamental underlying activity picking up and translating them into projects that people are pursuing, and we are getting a chance to participate in.

Great. Thanks very much for the color.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Clark from Societe Generale. Your line is open.
Peter Clark -- Societe Generale -- Analyst
Yes. Good afternoon everyone. I've got two questions. First one for Sanjiv, I think. About the productivity being embedded, obviously, in the PLC. Is the story now on productivity more about not adding costs back if the volumes continue to grow rather than savage cost cutting as such? Because I did notice, obviously, Q4 -- we'll get the Q1 numbers later in terms of the headcount and the severance costs. But they did slow, obviously, in the fourth quarter from the pace earlier in the year. And then for Matt, on the cash flow, I mean, the Q1 performance now is what we would normally see in the legacy companies, usually in Q4, which is normally the strongest quarter. I'm just wondering how that progresses through the year, given that you always make more money in the second half? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer
Peter, thanks. I'm going to give you a quick view on productivity. So you've heard me say this before, and I think Matt kind of made a very good observation earlier on, which is that we are always going to be very, very focused on managing our cost base. Our total cash fixed cost is something we kind of discuss every month at the business reviews that we carry out. So adding cost back is something we kind of manage actively. I think it doesn't necessarily translate into productivity because for productivity, we want to see that incremental action as well, which makes it tough. But it is in the DNA of the organization, Peter, and you've heard me talk kind of passionately about the fact that every individual in our organization has got a mandate to go out and look for productivity every day.
It's thousands of projects, which add small benefits but actually flow into the entire productivity part that we put together. There's one other thing which I think is now enabling that or helping us accelerate that, and that's around digitalization. And again, hopefully, you've heard me speak about this as well before. We're using digitalization, not as a significant tool that's going to create Earth-shattering new discoveries for us, but it's something that we apply in our business to deal with pain points every day. Our organizational model is embedded within the organization. So digital kind of expertise is being built up within every business across the world, and we are encouraging them. And in fact, I track it every quarter to ask them what percentage of productivity is coming from digital work or initiatives that w",2021-Q1,LIN,"[{'class_id': 0, 'class_name': 'correct', 'prob': 0.7341328339715323}, {'class_id': 1, 'class_name': 'incorrect', 'prob': 0.2658671660284677}]","[('John', 'PERSON'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('Asia', 'LOC'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('South Korea', 'GPE'), ('India', 'GPE'), ('ASEAN', 'ORG'), ('the quarter', 'DATE'), ('TSMC', 'ORG'), ('Samsung', 'ORG'), ('Intel', 'ORG'), ('John McNulty', 'PERSON'), ('BMO Capital Markets', 'ORG'), ('Peter Clark', 'PERSON'), ('Societe Generale', 'ORG'), ('Peter Clark', 'PERSON'), ('Societe Generale', 'ORG'), ('afternoon', 'TIME'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('First', 'ORDINAL'), ('Sanjiv', 'PERSON'), ('PLC', 'ORG'), ('Q4', 'ORG'), ('the fourth quarter', 'DATE'), ('earlier in the year', 'DATE'), ('Matt', 'PERSON'), ('Q4', 'GPE'), ('the year', 'DATE'), ('the second half', 'DATE'), ('Sanjiv Lamba', 'PERSON'), ('Peter', 'PERSON'), ('Matt', 'PERSON'), ('every month', 'DATE'), ('Peter', 'PERSON'), ('every day', 'DATE'), ('thousands', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Earth', 'LOC'), ('every day', 'DATE')]"

We also secured an advanced dielectric position with a major logic producer And then a bunch of pad opportunities that were able to be secured as well, including some consumable sets. So what we're seeing is not only a strong overall growth environment, but we're also winning new opportunities that, obviously, they ramp up or different trajectories over time. But I think the end state will be increased participation for us, as we've talked about. And so we're really pleased with CMP. One thing I'd note is that I think there's a lot of industry growth numbers that are being talked about probably in the kind of mid- to high single-digit range for the industry as everything is running pretty full. I'd say when you think about CMP, different parts of that semiconductor market are going to grow at different rates. We think CMP is probably growing at mid-single digits. So that gives you a proxy about how well we're doing in that area. I think we've outpaced CMP for a while now, and we continue to have plans to do so.
So that gives you a little bit of background on slurries and pads. On the EC side, yes, it's a different business for us. Obviously, it's a lot more regional. We participate in North America, Europe and a bit in Southeast Asia. Those markets are doing OK. But I think of EC as more of a solid growth business. It's not going to be as dynamic. It is a little bit more transient at least at the time -- since we've had it, under our portfolio. I would say that we're making some investments to improve our quality, to improve the technology of our offering and the supply chain. And I think that's going to further differentiate us from the other participants in that EC market. The other thing I would note is that a lot of the recent capacity expansions are in the U.S., particularly like TSMC and Intel. And so that should offer us additional growth opportunities for EC. But the growth trajectories are different for those different parts of our business.

What is the expected impact of the $280 million goodwill impairment charge on the overall portfolio of the company, I do not know the expected impact of the $280 million goodwill impairment charge on the overall portfolio of the company.,"May 7, 2021, 8:00 p.m. ET","ons in memory.
We also secured an advanced dielectric position with a major logic producer And then a bunch of pad opportunities that were able to be secured as well, including some consumable sets. So what we're seeing is not only a strong overall growth environment, but we're also winning new opportunities that, obviously, they ramp up or different trajectories over time. But I think the end state will be increased participation for us, as we've talked about. And so we're really pleased with CMP. One thing I'd note is that I think there's a lot of industry growth numbers that are being talked about probably in the kind of mid- to high single-digit range for the industry as everything is running pretty full. I'd say when you think about CMP, different parts of that semiconductor market are going to grow at different rates. We think CMP is probably growing at mid-single digits. So that gives you a proxy about how well we're doing in that area. I think we've outpaced CMP for a while now, and we continue to have plans to do so.
So that gives you a little bit of background on slurries and pads. On the EC side, yes, it's a different business for us. Obviously, it's a lot more regional. We participate in North America, Europe and a bit in Southeast Asia. Those markets are doing OK. But I think of EC as more of a solid growth business. It's not going to be as dynamic. It is a little bit more transient at least at the time -- since we've had it, under our portfolio. I would say that we're making some investments to improve our quality, to improve the technology of our offering and the supply chain. And I think that's going to further differentiate us from the other participants in that EC market. The other thing I would note is that a lot of the recent capacity expansions are in the U.S., particularly like TSMC and Intel. And so that should offer us additional growth opportunities for EC. But the growth trajectories are different for those different parts of our business.
Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs Group, Inc -- Analyst
Got it. That's super helpful. And then as a quick follow-up on the PM side. You guys booked a $280 million goodwill impairment charge. And I think in the prepared script, you talked about a lower-than-anticipated recovery post the pandemic and an increase in raw material costs. If you can kind of elaborate on those two points, what's changed over the past three months? And perhaps more importantly, post this writedown, Dave, how would you characterize the importance of the DRA business within the context of your overall portfolio?
Scott D. Beamer -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. So Toshiya, I'll start. Yes, you listed the two items that we mentioned in our materials. And I think as the raw material cost in the near to midterm, that's a supply demand issue in the marketplace. We won't be too specific about any particular material. But of course, you can expect us to work to manage that. So it doesn't have a significant impact in that over our rest of the year for our business. And any impact of that is included in the guidance that we increased both the top and the bottom end of that range. As we think about the lower than initially expected recovery, I think the accounting nuance aspect of this is important.
And you think about the strategic objectives of our business, which we are -- the team is working on may include things like continuing to develop our R&D portfolio, addressing some market adjacencies and other wind capture in the marketplace. We expect to get this business to a better level in the future. However, those sort of strategic objectives You're really not able to count much of those or perhaps any of those in the accounting model test. So we know this is a business that's been impacted by the pandemic. That is the big driver as we look forward in our future expectations of the business, That base business is challenged. That's going to be a lower type of recovery, but we expect that we're going to deliver on strategic objectives to get this business to a different place.

However, it is mentioned that TSMC is expanding its capacity to meet the demand for N6-based RF transceivers. It is also mentioned that the customer makes their decision to choose which technology node and to match their product design best. Therefore, it can be inferred that TSMC is working closely with its customers to determine the demand for N6-based RF transceivers and expanding its capacity accordingly.","Jan 13, 2022, 1:00 a.m. ET","n specifically on the N6-based RF transceiver. I recall that in your symposium back in June last year, you mentioned that the N6-based RF transceiver fr 5G. Can you give us more update, as we know that there's not much expansion on 16- or 12-nanometer, which is the major technology node for 5G, the RF transceiver?

OK, Laura. Let me try to summarize. Her questions about RF transceivers for 5G. She wants to know, there doesn't seem to be any major capacity expansion.
So what is TSMC's strategy for RF transceivers for 5G and also N6? You're talking in N16 or N6, sorry, Laura?

Yes.

C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
OK, Laura. We always are working with our customers closely, right? And the customer makes their decision to choose which technology node and to match their product design best. And you are right. Right now, transceiver is starting moving from 28-nanometer to 16, and now moving to N6.
We are expanding our capacity to meet the demand. That's all I can say. Did that answer your question?

Next one to ask questions, Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the really strong results. My first question is on gross margins. Wendell, you said long-term gross margin about 53%.
The last couple of quarters, you said it will be over 50%. So is it safe to assume that the price increases are the big reason for this increase in gross margin? And are these structural? Or are they cyclical? And is there some other variable in play given in gross margin improvement, since it's interesting that capex is going up, but the depreciation is not having an impact longer term on the gross margins? That's my first question.
Jeff Su
OK. Krish, let me summarize your first question. So Krish notes that Wendell is -- and C.C. said our long-term gross margin target -- last time we said 50% and higher.
Now today, we said 53% and higher. So is this because of price? And is this a cyclical element only? Or is this something structural in terms of a higher 53% and higher long-term gross margin target?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Well, let me share with you that. We're talking about long term. So several years down the road.
I think that shouldn't be a cyclical issue. So previously, it's long term, 50% and higher. Now it's long term, 53% and higher, OK? So that's the difference. And we are working closely with our customers and suppliers to both sell our value and drive our cost improvements.

Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst
That's helpful. And then, just to check in, you guys have talked about the supply chain, and you're benefiting at the expense of alternatives. Can you talk about the traditional of course crystals suppliers? You've seen some struggle there. Are you seeing any effort to ramp capacity there? Is there any tangible effort there that's having success? Can you just talk about where you're positioned versus that traditional competition and if you think that there's any capacity coming online anytime soon?
Rajesh Vashist -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I do think that there -- I anticipate I don't have any data around it, but I anticipate that there'll be more capacity coming on. I particularly think that in general, with the large expansion of all component capacity in China, in Mainland China, I think they will also be expanding. But to me, I don't know if I think of that as competition because we -- our products are significantly differentiated from those products to really matter. As an example, the XCalibur product the active resonator product is a very, very distinct product.
In fact, its own category, as I mentioned. So I don't know how much that impacts us directly, it impacts us in the general way that customers have come to us because of shortages, maybe that gets a little bit slower. On the other hand, I think because of the products that I mentioned that we are coming out with, the pace of new customer acquisition gets higher. So net-net, I think we are in a good place.

Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Let me ask the question. Art, I just want to go back to your comments about increasing cost hitting gross margins starting in the June quarter.
I mean, TSMC is raising pricing kind of across the board. We're hearing that with many of their customers. But the vast majority of them are just being able to pass those costs along. I'm kind of curious, given that you've exhibited perhaps stronger pricing power than a lot of other chip players in calendar year '21.
Why all of a sudden, this is an issue this year and why you just can't pass those cost increases along?
Art Chadwick -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, so I think, there's a couple of pieces to the answer there. First of all, these wafer cost price increases began at the beginning of the year. And so, we did not have to worry about that last year. I can't speak to 2023 because we don't know what will happen there.
But in 2022, wafer prices are going up, and they went up at the beginning of the year. You don't see in our P&L in Q1 because essentially, the finished goods that we are selling in Q1 is coming from wafer as we bought in Q4. So that's why it doesn't impact Q1, but it starts impacting in Q2. And that's a real cost increase, it's solid, it's real.
So your question is, why can't we increase pricing? We have increased some pricing. As I mentioned, we can increase pricing even more, but there's that trade-off between increasing pricing to our customers and growth, and we're trying to find the right balance there. And the 2- to 3-point decrease that incorporates some increased pricing. If you look at our wafer cost and other manufacturing costs going up 20-plus percent, that's more than just 2 or 3 points.
So the 2 or 3 points is kind of net of price increases that we're anticipating. And that all customers will accept price increases. If you just look at some of our large customers, you can imagine how they would say, we are really not interested in that. So I don't know if that helps answer that, but I tried to add a little flavor to it.

That's helpful. And then, just to check in, you guys have talked about the supply chain, and you're benefiting at the expense of alternatives. Can you talk about the traditional of course crystals suppliers? You've seen some struggle there. Are you seeing any effort to ramp capacity there? Is there any tangible effort there that's having success? Can you just talk about where you're positioned versus that traditional competition and if you think that there's any capacity coming online anytime soon?
Rajesh Vashist -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I do think that there -- I anticipate I don't have any data around it, but I anticipate that there'll be more capacity coming on. I particularly think that in general, with the large expansion of all component capacity in China, in Mainland China, I think they will also be expanding. But to me, I don't know if I think of that as competition because we -- our products are significantly differentiated from those products to really matter. As an example, the XCalibur product the active resonator product is a very, very distinct product.
In fact, its own category, as I mentioned. So I don't know how much that impacts us directly, it impacts us in the general way that customers have come to us because of shortages, maybe that gets a little bit slower. On the other hand, I think because of the products that I mentioned that we are coming out with, the pace of new customer acquisition gets higher. So net-net, I think we are in a good place.

For the full year of 2021, we now forecast the overall semiconductor market excluding memory, to grow about 12%, while foundry industry growth is forecast to be about 16%. For TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow by around 20% in 2021 in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, let me talk about our capital budget for this year. Every year, our capex is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. As we enter a period of higher growth, underpinned by the multi-year structural megatrends of 5G related and HPC applications, we believe a higher level of capital investment is necessary to capture the future growth opportunities. In order to meet the increasing demand for our advanced and specialty technologies in the next several years, we have decided to raise our full-year 2021 capex to be around $30 billion. About 80% of the 2021 capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, including 3-nanometer 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making, and about 10% will be spent for specialty technologies.
Now, let me turn the microphone over to C. C.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Wendall. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time. First let me talk about the capacity shortage and demand outlook. Our customers are currently facing challenges from the industry wide semiconductor capacity shortage, which is driven by both structural increase in long-term demand, as well as short-term imbalance in the supply chain. We are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand, as a multi-year megatrend of 5G and HPC related applications are expected to fuel strong demand for our revised technologies in the next several years. COVID-19 has also fundamentally accelerated the digital transformation, making semiconductors more pervasive than essential in people's life. In addition, the need to ensure supply security is creating short-term imbalance in the supply chain, driven by supply chain disruption, due to COVID-19 and uncertainties brought about by geopolitical tensions.
Now let me talk about TSMC's investment plan and disciplines. TSMC's submission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logica IC industry for years to come. In order to support our customers of course, TSMC is taking several actions to help adjust the capacity shortage for our customers. We are working hard to increase our productivity, to drive more output, to help support our customers for the near term.
To address the structural increase in the long-term demand profile. We are working closely with our customers, and investing to support the demand. We have acquired land and component, and started the construction of new facilities. We are hiring thousands of employees and expanding our capacity at multiple sites. TSMC expects to invest about $100 billion over the next three years to increase capacity, to support the manufacturing in R&D of leading edge and specialty technologies. Increase capacity expected to improve supply certainty for our customers and have strengthened confidence in global supply chains that rely on semiconductors.
Our capital investment decision based on four disciplines; technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust and earning the proper return. At the same time, we faced manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading node. New investment in mature nodes, and rising material costs. Therefore, we are continuing to work closely with customers, to see our value. Our value improves the value of our technology, the value of our service and the value of our capacity support to customers.
We are looking to firm up our wafer pricing to a reasonable level. We will continue to work diligently with our suppliers to deliver on cost improvement.

In 2022 itself, we will sample six of these oscillators and clocks. These address the macro trends that I referred to that are transforming electronics, high-bandwidth communications, cloud, EV and IoT.
With these, we are confident in our ability to transform the electronics industry driven by greater adoption of these products. We expect that the stellar comms enterprise performance will continue into the second half with the volume ramping up of applications like 400G, 800G optical modules and data center switches. In our last call, we talked about a clock family with 200 customers by the end of '22, and that strength continues. 60% Of the Cascade, the clock family, revenue in '22 and '23 will now come from midcars, 5G RRU, and backhaul.
Our investment in this segment is working. In 2022, comms enterprise is expected to grow to over 25% of our revenue compared to 16% last year in 2021. For example, again, our Elite product is expected to grow three times in revenue over 2021. The value and uniqueness of SiTime products is also clearly on display at our largest customer, which is in the mobile IoT consumer segment.
Our revenue here continues to grow strongly in the second half of 2022, and the design win funnel continues to grow strongly as well. In the previous call, we have spoken about the strength of aero defense business. We're now engaged with the top defense contractors worldwide and our funnel continues to grow as they discover the strength of our unique precision timing products. The uniqueness of these SiTime products comes from the uniqueness of SiTime technology.
We've always maintained that our MEMS, analog circuits and the systems, putting it together to deliver a system solution is hard to do. In the past decade, we have not seen a credible competitor that is using similar technologies, and we don't see one on the horizon currently. A great advantage for SiTime during the turmoil of the past two years has been the flexibility and the solidity of our supply chain. We've made great inroads with customers because our supply chain has been proven to be superior to that of our existing -- to that of the existing suppliers in the market today.
That strength continues due to the support of TSMC, Bosch and our OSAT partners. Given that a majority of our customers are single sourced, our supply chain strength continues to be a competitive advantage for SiTime. In conclusion, as a category creator of precision timing, SiTime is uniquely positioned to transform this industry. We believe that our long-term growth and market share gains will continue unabated in the future.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Art Chadwick, our CFO.

What is the current percentage of revenue from testing for ASX , The current percentage of revenue from testing for ASX is not mentioned in the transcript.,"Jul 29, 2021, 3:00 a.m. ET","have factories across the three continents, and Japan, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, as well as US and China, and of course, Taiwan. So in terms of the global diversification, we are already there. Okay? So the next question is, under the geopolitical sensitivity, as well as the US incentive, as well as the China initiative, how to respond to like TSMC or Samsung, or Intel initiative, in building up the different capacity in different part of the world. And I think the short answer of that is the -- it really goes by the business dynamics.
If I want to be a little bit more specific, you will look at the overall semiconductor demand, which is given by the pyramid picture that I gave to everyone. When you dissect the pyramid into two portions, you ask, which part of the pyramid are cost sensitive. And you will develop your manufacturing in a massive scale to offer the most cost effective, flexible delivery to that part of the pyramid that are processed. After that, you will have a little piece, a smaller piece, which is national security sensitive, technology sensitive or location sensitive. Then you will look at, who are the end user, who are the service provider? For those service provider and end user, which portion of the assembly and test can we contribute to add efficiency to the alternative route? So this process sounds very complicated, but actually is very, very simple.
So if any of the foundry partner wants to build a fab anywhere in the world, we look at the output, we look at the assembly and test requirement. Then we ask the question, does it have to be ASE? If it does, what will be the volume that is required comparing to any other alternative route? When all fails, we will make the investment accordingly based on the business need. So right now we already have a globally diversified footprint, but to make adjustment on the footprint, by adding different service portfolio will really depend on the business. And by the way, that business requirement as of today is not clear for the assembly and test.

Joseph Tung -- Chief Financial Officer
Well I think right at the peak we were around 10% and I think that's the first thing that we need to go back for.

However, it is also true that demand for energy-efficient computing is accelerating in an intelligent and connected world as technology is becoming more pervasive and essential in people's lives. The semiconductor industry value in the supply chain is increasing, and the value of technology platform is expanding beyond the scope of geometry shrink alone and increasingly toward greater power efficiency.
As a result, our customers value much more than simply transistor cost. System performance and power efficiency has become key motivation for customers who adopt our leading node technologies. By working closely with our customer and technology development, our N3 and N2 will deliver full node stride in performance and power benefits while offering the industry's most advanced transistor scaling. We expect strong demand for our leading node technologies, driven by both smartphone and HPC applications to fuel our long-term revenue growth of 15% to 20% CAGR over the next several years in U.S.
dollar terms. With our leadership in both leading-edge process technology and 3D solutions, TSMC's technology cadence remain constant to deliver the value of our technology platform.

Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the great results, especially on the margins. So the first question is on N7 and N6, this utilization slack that we are observing. Could we give a little bit more detail on why that is happening and why we think this is short-lived, a couple of quarters issue and we get a pick back in the utilization in the second half of the year? And I think last time we saw, this was for 28-nanometer, but that lasted for a much longer period of time.
So could you also give us some kind of comparison with what happened back in 28-nanometer and why this is going to be very different? And maybe a little bit more color on what are the areas of backfill demand for N7 and N6 as the high-end smartphone processors and HPC start to move on to N5 and then N3.

Over the last three years, we have raised our capex spending from USD 14.9 billion in 2019 to USD 30 billion in 2021 as we invest in anticipation of the growth that will follow. During the same period, our revenue in US dollar term has increased from USD 34.6 billion in 2019 to USD 56.8 billion in 2021 or 1.6 times and our EPS by 1.7 times.
Looking ahead, as the world's largest reliable and effective capacity provider with our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customer trust, we are well-positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry mega trend with our differentiated technologies. We expect our long-term revenue to be between 15% and 20% CAGR over the next several years in US dollar terms, of course, fueled by all four growth platform which are smartphone, HPC, IoT, and automotive. With the increasing need for computation, HPC will be the strongest driver of TSMC's long-term growth and expect it to be the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth with the CPU, GPU, and AI accelerators are the main growth area for our HPC platform. As we invest in leading-edge and specialty technology to support our customers' demand, we continue to face manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading-edge node, new investment in mature node, expansion of our global manufacturing footprint, and rising materials and basic commodity cost.
We are continuing to work closely with our customer to support their growth, and our pricing strategy will remain strategic not optimistic to reflect our value creation. We will also work diligently in our own fab operation and with our suppliers to deliver on cost improvement. By taking such actions, we believe our long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable, and we can earn a sustainable and proper return of greater than 25% ROE through that cycle. Thus, even as we shoulder a greater burden of capex investment for the industry, we can continue to invest to support our customers' growth and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.
Now I will talk about N5 and N4P and N4X status. As our N5 enter its third year of ramp, demand continues to be very strong, driven by smartphone and HPC applications. Our N5 has proven to be the industry's most competitive leading-edge technology. To further enhance our N5 family's performance, power, and density improvement for next-wave 5-nanometer products, we also introduced the N4P and N4X technologies.
N4P offers 11% performance boost as compared to the N5 with 22% improvement in power efficiency and 6% density gain. N4P is designed for easy migration from N5 with its products taking our schedule for second half 2022. We also introduced N4X as an offering especially optimized for workload-intensive HPC applications. N4X will offer much more circuit performance boost over N5 and we expect it to enter its production in first half 2023.
With our continuous enhancement of our N5 process technologies, we expect demand for our N5 family to continue to grow in the next several years, and for N5 family to be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Next, let me talk about the N3 and N3E status, our N3 technology wide-use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track. We have developed complete performance support for both HPC and the smartphone applications.
N3 production will start in second half of 2022. We continue to see a high level of customer engagement at N3, and expect the more new tape-outs for N3 for the fourth year as compared with N5. N3E will further extend our N3E family with the enhanced performance, power, and yield. We also observed a high level of customer engagement at N3E, and volume production is scheduled for one year after N3.

So maybe we can make very clear to you guys. Our backlog is building today is over $1 billion. If we have a sufficient supply, this year, we can achieve over $1 billion sales target. However, we are not able to due to wafer supply shortage. Now we secure additional wafer supply, which is supported to continued growth for next year. It's too early to comment 2022 guidance, but we believe we'll continue growth for 2022. And if we can continue to negotiate with TSMC to support major critical program because if we cannot get a sufficient supply, that will impact the ecosystem negatively. So this is very important for us and also for our customer and for the whole industry.

Thank you for that. That's very helpful. And just my follow-up, I'm -- I'll step back in the queue. Riyadh, the gross margin is kind of dipping to 46.5% range in the second half. You talked about that the pricing is committed or predetermined. And at the same time, there's back end, substrate costs that are increasing. That clearly is transitory. But I'm curious in terms of when do you expect the back end of the substrate cost starting to subside? Is that still is going to be dependent on the capacity constrained environment? And how do you think about that balancing that with, say, the pricing commitments going into 2022, kind of looking past the second half? How are you balancing the kind of the pricing dynamic with the back end and substrate costs that have been increasing? Thank you.
Riyadh Lai -- Chief Financial Officer
That's a very good question, Raji. We're -- this is also tied in with do we think foundry supply will ease up. So related to this topic is when do we expect substrate and back-end tightness to also ease up. Frankly, it's not that clear right now. We are seeing improvements on the back end and substrates. But when will this lead to a better cost structure in terms of pricing of back end and substrates to us, we're still not quite sure. We are keeping a very close eye on this and continue to see if we can negotiate better terms. And this is something we'll be updating everyone in the following quarters.

Yes Thank you. Two questions, please. I guess, Riyadh, how sustainable are these OEM programs? You've indicated contractual agreements with NAND OEMs, but I'm curious if you could discuss the volume commitments you have with the OEMs that extend into the second half and into 2022 in the event capacity constraints ease and how that may increase the risk that those OEMs move back toward internal controller solutions?
Riyadh Lai -- Chief Financial Officer
Karl, I'll let Wallace answer this question.
Wallace C. Kou -- President, Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I think these OEM programs are not easy to be replaced by either third-party controller or internal controller because it's need to predesign and have to be -- put a lot of effort in the design qualification and through their customer verification. And I think we already have a full year forecast from 2022. So we know exactly what is going to last. And this is not just a solution. This is a industrial standard and will continue going to stay for more than three or four years in the next three to four years. So I think the we have -- I think we have a contract price.

But when will this lead to a better cost structure in terms of pricing of back end and substrates to us, we're still not quite sure. We are keeping a very close eye on this and continue to see if we can negotiate better terms. And this is something we'll be updating everyone in the following quarters.

Karl Ackerman -- Cowen -- Analyst
Yes Thank you. Two questions, please. I guess, Riyadh, how sustainable are these OEM programs? You've indicated contractual agreements with NAND OEMs, but I'm curious if you could discuss the volume commitments you have with the OEMs that extend into the second half and into 2022 in the event capacity constraints ease and how that may increase the risk that those OEMs move back toward internal controller solutions?
Riyadh Lai -- Chief Financial Officer
Karl, I'll let Wallace answer this question.
Wallace C. Kou -- President, Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I think these OEM programs are not easy to be replaced by either third-party controller or internal controller because it's need to predesign and have to be -- put a lot of effort in the design qualification and through their customer verification. And I think we already have a full year forecast from 2022. So we know exactly what is going to last. And this is not just a solution. This is a industrial standard and will continue going to stay for more than three or four years in the next three to four years. So I think the we have -- I think we have a contract price. And it's been discussed two years ago, nobody can predict the the COVID-19 and the wafer shortage and all these manufacture issue.

What is the expected gross margin for the company in the second half of the year?," The expected gross margin for the company in the second half of the year is not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, it is mentioned that the gross margin is currently in the range of 46.5% and that it is expected to improve in the future as the company secures additional wafer supply and negotiates better terms for substrate and back-end costs.","May 6, 2021, 8:00 a.m. ET","u could get that -- to get to that number sooner? I'm just curious that you feel that you could get to that number sooner, however, the capacity constraints are still fairly significant.
Wallace C. Kou -- President, Chief Executive Officer
So maybe we can make very clear to you guys. Our backlog is building today is over $1 billion. If we have a sufficient supply, this year, we can achieve over $1 billion sales target. However, we are not able to due to wafer supply shortage. Now we secure additional wafer supply, which is supported to continued growth for next year. It's too early to comment 2022 guidance, but we believe we'll continue growth for 2022. And if we can continue to negotiate with TSMC to support major critical program because if we cannot get a sufficient supply, that will impact the ecosystem negatively. So this is very important for us and also for our customer and for the whole industry. So we believe we current secure additional wafer will support our growth for 2022, but we cannot comment what eventually sale revenue will be. But we believe we'll be probably early than 2023 is likely.
Rajvindra Gill Gill -- Needham Company. -- Analyst
Thank you for that. That's very helpful. And just my follow-up, I'm -- I'll step back in the queue. Riyadh, the gross margin is kind of dipping to 46.5% range in the second half. You talked about that the pricing is committed or predetermined. And at the same time, there's back end, substrate costs that are increasing. That clearly is transitory. But I'm curious in terms of when do you expect the back end of the substrate cost starting to subside? Is that still is going to be dependent on the capacity constrained environment? And how do you think about that balancing that with, say, the pricing commitments going into 2022, kind of looking past the second half? How are you balancing the kind of the pricing dynamic with the back end and substrate costs that have been increasing? Thank you.

C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Laura, our HPC definitely is growing here. And since TSMC, everybody's foundry. So we support both x86 and ARM based for what you say for the high-performance computing, both. And both are significantly growing in TSMC.

But Charlie, we -- from now on, we have to look at the technology in a platform fashion.
The N2 technology is not just the wafer scaling.

What is the expected market share for Silicon Motion in the eMMC controller market next year if the company is able to provide sufficient wafer support , The expected market share for Silicon Motion in the eMMC controller market next year if the company is able to provide sufficient wafer support is more than 50%.,"Oct 28, 2021, 8:00 a.m. ET","solution cost dramatically and also increase the capacity for consumer to use -- to embrace all different new applications for the 5G.

That's really helpful, Wallace. The second question I had is related to the eMMC market and it seems that there's some very encouraging supply side dynamics taking place as Silicon Motion really takes advantage of a situation where Samsung and Hynix are exiting the market. So the question is this, if the company is able to provide us with market share data on the SSD controller side and five to 10 percentage points of gains this year and expected next year. Is there some similar color that you can provide on the eMMC market so we can get a better grasp of the magnitude of share that you're picking up there as the supply side consolidates to your favor?
Chia-Chang Kou -- President, Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Let me just put some color. So you understand where we are in our position is in eMMC controller. For 2021, this year, unfortunately, we have wafer allocation. Our eMMC backlog is a much bigger allocated wafer we can supply. Because in the past, EMC controller are designed with the legacy technology node, primarily with the 55-nanometer and 40-nanometer. These mature technology node, we have much less [Indecipherable] 34:13 from TSMC and other foundry supplier. So this year, we're busy to porting a new product into 28-nanometer. So to expand our VMC criteria because our backlog, frankly speaking, for EMC is even higher than 500 million units today. But through the wafer allocating to us, we can probably only support 60% of the backlog.
And we do see an increasing demand from the multiple customer, not just China, Taiwan or Korea, but also from U.S. and Europe and really, very, very strong demand in multi-market application, not just the low end smartphone, but also in all the smart families like Smart TV, smart speakers, smart watch, all the IoT devices, automotive and Chromebook. So this is a very, very strong demand, even some NAND maker because they ask it from EMC, but they still want to provide solution. [Indecipherable] 35:21 come to SMI. So we really have obligation to expand our wafer supply to support to these customers to avoid any potential market segment breakdown. So this is our obligation and try to really increase all the available technology wafer to us to make it more cost effective, also prepared for upcoming new TLC NAND and as well as the legacy NAND support. I just really cannot say what market share we have definitely more than 30%, but just if we can have a sufficient wafer support, we can easily achieve more than 50% of market share next year.
Craig A. Ellis -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst
That's really helpful, Wallace. And then I'll follow-up with one to Riyadh, so that I don't ignore you, and then I'll hand it off to others. So the question is this, Riyadh. So given that the company year-to-date has talked about four drivers to executing on gross margin, richer mix, allocations to more profitable accounts, recovering manufacturing costs and then doing things on the back end and with things like transition from much more mature nodes to 28-nanometer for eMMC it seems there would be significant momentum to keep the trajectory on gross margin moving higher next year. So why would we not see gross margin moving up next year versus something that's at 50%, admittedly, a good point relative to the target range, but it seems there's momentum in the business for something that would be higher.

So this is our obligation and try to really increase all the available technology wafer to us to make it more cost effective, also prepared for upcoming new TLC NAND and as well as the legacy NAND support. I just really cannot say what market share we have definitely more than 30%, but just if we can have a sufficient wafer support, we can easily achieve more than 50% of market share next year.

That's really helpful, Wallace. And then I'll follow-up with one to Riyadh, so that I don't ignore you, and then I'll hand it off to others. So the question is this, Riyadh. So given that the company year-to-date has talked about four drivers to executing on gross margin, richer mix, allocations to more profitable accounts, recovering manufacturing costs and then doing things on the back end and with things like transition from much more mature nodes to 28-nanometer for eMMC it seems there would be significant momentum to keep the trajectory on gross margin moving higher next year. So why would we not see gross margin moving up next year versus something that's at 50%, admittedly, a good point relative to the target range, but it seems there's momentum in the business for something that would be higher.

What is the expected increase in capacity for TSMC over the next three years to improve supply certainty for customers , The expected increase in capacity for TSMC over the next three years to improve supply certainty for customers is $100 billion.,"Apr 15, 2021, 2:00 a.m. ET","hain, driven by supply chain disruption, due to COVID-19 and uncertainties brought about by geopolitical tensions.
Now let me talk about TSMC's investment plan and disciplines. TSMC's submission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logica IC industry for years to come. In order to support our customers of course, TSMC is taking several actions to help adjust the capacity shortage for our customers. We are working hard to increase our productivity, to drive more output, to help support our customers for the near term.
To address the structural increase in the long-term demand profile. We are working closely with our customers, and investing to support the demand. We have acquired land and component, and started the construction of new facilities. We are hiring thousands of employees and expanding our capacity at multiple sites. TSMC expects to invest about $100 billion over the next three years to increase capacity, to support the manufacturing in R&D of leading edge and specialty technologies. Increase capacity expected to improve supply certainty for our customers and have strengthened confidence in global supply chains that rely on semiconductors.
Our capital investment decision based on four disciplines; technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust and earning the proper return. At the same time, we faced manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading node. New investment in mature nodes, and rising material costs. Therefore, we are continuing to work closely with customers, to see our value. Our value improves the value of our technology, the value of our service and the value of our capacity support to customers.
We are looking to firm up our wafer pricing to a reasonable level. We will continue to work diligently with our suppliers to deliver on cost improvement. By taking such actions, we believe we can continue to earn a proper return that enable us to invest, to support our customers, of course, and fulfill our mission as trusted foundry partners. We saw technology leadership, manufacturing excellence, and customer trust. We are well positioned to capture it of course, from the favorable industry megatrend. We reiterate our long-term revenue to be 10% to 15% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, let me talk about the automotive supply update. The automotive market has been soft since 2018. Entering 2020, COVID-19 further impacted the automotive market. The automotive supply chain was affected throughout the year, and our customers continue to reduce their demand, throughout the third quarter of 2020. We only began to see sudden recovery in the fourth quarter of 2020. However the automotive supply chain is long and complex, which is on inventory management practices. From chip production to car production, it takes at least six months with several tiers of suppliers in between. TSMC is doing its part to address the chip supply challenges for our customers.
In January of this year, TSMC announced that capacity support for automotive customers is our top priority. Since then, we have worked dynamically with our other customer, to reallocate our wafer capacity to support the worldwide automotive industry. However, the shortage further deteriorated due to the unexpected snowstorm in Texas, and a fab manufacturing disruption in Japan. Together with our productivity improvement, we expect the automotive component shortage from semiconductor to be greatly reduced for TSMC's customer by the next quarter.
Now I will talk about Taiwan water supply update. The water supply in Taiwan is currently tight, due to the lack of rainfall in the past year. We have been prepared for this.

Thank you for taking my question. Happy New Year and fantastic results and guidance. So, let me ask a question first on 3-nanometer. Dr. Wei, how should we think about the size of 3-nanometer? What we have seen is, over the last two years, 28-nanometer was a very big node, 7-nanometer came out to be roughly 70% bigger, if you think about peak revenue, compared to 28-nanometer when you had new applications coming in. How -- given the big capex plan that you are also outlining, should we think that 3-nanometer, once it ramps up fully, would be substantially bigger than 7-nanometer in terms of peak revenues? Just wondering, how we should kind of think about the size of this process node.
And could you also talk a little bit about the opportunities within HPC? Right now you are already engaged with multiple HPC customers, but could you talk a little bit about CPU -- x86 CPU, obviously, which is something on everybody's mind. Could you talk a little bit about how do you think it would be exposed to this market as well as we go into the 3-nanometer era?

However, it is mentioned that SoIC is expected to be first adopted by HPC applications, where bandwidth performance, power efficiency, and form factor are aggressively pursued.","Jan 14, 2021, 1:00 a.m. ET","in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident our 3-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, I will talk about TSMC's 3D fabric. TSMC has developed an industry-leading and comprehensive wafer-level 3DIC technology roadmap to enhance system-level performance. Our differentiated chiplet and heterogeneous integration technologies drive better power efficiency, as smaller form factor benefit for our customer, while shortening their time to market. This technology, including CHIPS stake in solution, such as SoIC, as well as our advanced packaging solutions, such as InFO and CoWoS. We observe chiplets are becoming an industry trend. We are working with several customers on 3D fabric to enable chiplet architecture. SoIC's full volume production is targeted in 2022. SoIC is expected to be first adopted by HPC applications, where bandwidth performance, power efficiency and form factor are aggressively pursued. We expect revenue from our back-end services, which include InFO's advanced packaging and testing to grow at a rate higher than corporate average in the next few years.
This concluding our key message. Thank you for your attention.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Thank you, C.C. This concludes our prepared statements. Before we start the Q&A session, I would like to remind everybody to please limit your questions to two at a time to allow all the participants an opportunity to ask their questions. Should you raise to -- wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate into English before our management answers your question.
[Operator Instructions] Now, let's begin the Q&A session. Operator, please proceed with the first caller on the line.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
Yes. The first one to ask question, Gokul Hariharan from J.P. Morgan.
Gokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Thank you for taking my question. Happy New Year and fantastic results and guidance. So, let me ask a question first on 3-nanometer. Dr. Wei, how should we think about the size of 3-nanometer? What we have seen is, over the last two years, 28-nanometer was a very big node, 7-nanometer came out to be roughly 70% bigger, if you think about peak revenue, compared to 28-nanometer when you had new applications coming in. How -- given the big capex plan that you are also outlining, should we think that 3-nanometer, once it ramps up fully, would be substantially bigger than 7-nanometer in terms of peak revenues? Just wondering, how we should kind of think about the size of this process node.
And could you also talk a little bit about the opportunities within HPC? Right now you are already engaged with multiple HPC customers, but could you talk a little bit about CPU -- x86 CPU, obviously, which is something on everybody's mind. Could you talk a little bit about how do you think it would be exposed to this market as well as we go into the 3-nanometer era?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Gokul, sorry, this is Jeff. Let me please summarize your questions -- two questions, we'll take them in the -- one by one. Gokul's first question is with regards to 3-nanometer and about the size of our 3-nanometer. He notes that in the past we have had very big nodes, such as 28-nanometer and then 7-nanometer. So, Gokul wants to know in terms of the peak revenue contribution, do we expect or should N3 be substantially bigger than N7. That's his first question. Correct?
Gokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Yeah. Especially considering the step-up in capex as well. Thank you.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, Gokul, let me answer your question by saying that we do expect the 3-nanometer will be widely used in HPC-related applications in addition to the smartphones. So, with this kind of engagement with our customer, we do expect our revenue will be bigger, certainly. There's no doubt about it.
So, what is the next question?

Jeff Su
OK. Well, Brad's second question is on substrates. He wants to know, with the development of substrates and the adoption, do we see further developments in terms of new materials? Will we see more substrates used in 3D IC versus 2.5D? And will we -- how do we secure the substrate supply?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, this one we are working with the substrate partner. And your question is the 2D, 2.5D or 3D, both, both are important. But let me tell you one further step. We're only interested in the very advance technology.
We are not going to develop any commodity of the substrate technology to compete in the market. No. We are developing for the very high-performance computing or very large substrate to support TSMC's customer. That's our purpose.

Operator
Next one to ask questions, Krish Sankar from Cowen & Company.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them.
The first one is, when I look at your full year guidance of 35% revenue growth, it looks like calendar 4Q or the December quarter is going to be sequentially down more than 10%. And that hasn't happened in a long time. So I'm kind of curious, how much of that is driven by demand versus FX? And then the second question, a follow-up is, if I look at your capex run rate, the first half is running at about NT 17 billion, which is below the lower end of your full-year guidance. So I'm kind of curious, what are the tool delays that's causing the pushout of capex into next year? Is it like EUV? Is it like depth edge tools? Any color on that would be super helpful.
Jeff Su
OK. So Krish has two questions. First is looking at our full-year guidance to grow mid-30s, and he says this implies a decline in the fourth quarter?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
No. I don't think so. We did the calculation. Maybe you can do that again.
It's at least up.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Krish, I would note that when we talk about mid-30s guidance, as C.C. said, that is in U.S. dollar terms.
OK?
Jeff Su
And then his second question is on capex and sort of looking at the capex. His question is we have already said it will be closer to the lower end of the range. He wants to know what is driving the capex? Is it tool delays? Is it EUV? What types of equipment?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No. I don't think we can go into that kind of details. But some of them got pushed out to next year, as C.C. mentioned.
And every year, the capex profile can be difference quarter by quarter.
Jeff Su
Yeah. OK.

Yes. The next one to ask questions, Frank Lee from HSBC.
Frank Lee -- HSBC -- Analyst
Thank you. I wanted to just ask a question on, I guess, the overall profitability and also pricing. It seems like this year, we start to see a foundry price increase and a bit unusual for TSMC. And going into next year, it looks like there's some manifestation of further price increases.
But at the same time, we're also seeing potentially inventory correction. So just trying to understand the pricing strategy itself, is this more of a reflection of perhaps the structural profitability for this cycle being different than the past? Or are there any kind of cost that we're seeing this time that we haven't seen in past cycles.

What is the expected growth rate for the foundry industry in the next several years ," The expected growth rate for the foundry industry in the next several years is not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, it is mentioned that the foundry industry growth will be higher due to the increasing demand for fabless companies, IDM outsourcing, and system companies. The transcript also mentions that the HPC segment is growing faster, but the specific growth rate for each segment (CPU, GPU, and AI accelerator) is not disclosed.","Jan 13, 2022, 1:00 a.m. ET","rmation for the next several years.
So -- but if you look at the -- if we -- want me to comment on the foundry industry, it's pretty clear. The foundry industry growth will be higher because, in addition to a fabless company, IDM outsourcing will continue increasing in a fast growth rate. And most importantly, system companies will grow, particularly faster during this period of time. So in that sense, we believe the foundry growth -- foundry industry growth will have a good year better than other sectors.
Jeff Su
And then Bruce also asking about the role of HPC in this growth outlook, including the ARM.
Mark Liu -- Chairman
Well, ARM is a new phenomenon. I think the CPU architecture no longer been dominant by one architecture. Multiple architecture provided their better integration with software, provide a much wider application of CPUs. And that no matter what the CPU, which architecture they are, currently, we are engaging to all CPU architecture customers.
Jeff Su
OK. Bruce, does that answer your first question?
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Yes. But I try to ask a follow-up for the -- addressing for HPC. I mean within that HPC, we understand that this is the faster growing segment. Can you provide some more like different like growth magnitude within the HPC? Which part of the HPC is growing faster? And how big could that be in three to five years?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, Bruce, this is C.C. Wei again. No, we cannot disclose all the details on each segment. for example, CPU, GPU and AI accelerator, which one is more -- what kind of percentage.
In fact, they are all growing, but for the specific percentage, we don't comment right now.
Jeff Su
OK, Bruce?
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
I understand. Yes.
Jeff Su
OK. do you have a second question?
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Yes. The second question is regarding to the 28-nanometer, actually know that 28-nanometer is the biggest node among all the process node within TSMC, and which is suffer lower retention rate in 2018 and '19. So with the recent announcement in Nanjing or Japan or even in Gaozhou, it suggest another 16% of capacity growth in 28-nanometer alone in TSMC. Not to mention like your industry peer are all aggressively in expanding the 28-nanometer.
Can you provide like more like growth driver? And how can you feel comfortable to expand the capacity in this magnitude in the coming years when a lot of like financial industry we're talking about, like down cycle or a cycle peak or oversupply in 2023?
Jeff Su
OK. Bruce's second question is on 28-nanometer. He notes that we are, as C.C. said, expanding our capacity in 28-nanometer in various locations, but he also notes that other foundry peers in the industry are also expanding as well.
So he wants to know the risk, I guess, of oversupply.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, good question. As you pointed out in 2018, 2019, we have a lower utilization rate. It's just a little bit above 80%. But right now, we do observe that our long-term structural demand at 28-nanometer was to be well supported by multiple specialty technologies such as CMOS image sensor for multi-camera trend and better nonvolatile memory application and other specialty technologies.
To be in one word, actually, the enrichment in the silicon content in many end devices that develop in recent years helped to support this demand.

"What is the expected growth rate for the HPC segment in the next several years, and which part of the HPC is expected to grow faster? "," The expected growth rate for the HPC segment in the next several years is not disclosed in the transcript. However, it is mentioned that HPC is the fastest-growing segment within TSMC. The transcript also mentions that the ARM architecture is a new phenomenon and that TSMC is engaging with all CPU architecture customers.

Regarding the specific growth rate for each part of the HPC segment, the transcript does not provide detailed information. However, it is mentioned that all parts of the HPC segment, including CPU, GPU, and AI accelerator, are growing.","Jan 13, 2022, 1:00 a.m. ET","rmation for the next several years.
So -- but if you look at the -- if we -- want me to comment on the foundry industry, it's pretty clear. The foundry industry growth will be higher because, in addition to a fabless company, IDM outsourcing will continue increasing in a fast growth rate. And most importantly, system companies will grow, particularly faster during this period of time. So in that sense, we believe the foundry growth -- foundry industry growth will have a good year better than other sectors.
Jeff Su
And then Bruce also asking about the role of HPC in this growth outlook, including the ARM.
Mark Liu -- Chairman
Well, ARM is a new phenomenon. I think the CPU architecture no longer been dominant by one architecture. Multiple architecture provided their better integration with software, provide a much wider application of CPUs. And that no matter what the CPU, which architecture they are, currently, we are engaging to all CPU architecture customers.
Jeff Su
OK. Bruce, does that answer your first question?
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Yes. But I try to ask a follow-up for the -- addressing for HPC. I mean within that HPC, we understand that this is the faster growing segment. Can you provide some more like different like growth magnitude within the HPC? Which part of the HPC is growing faster? And how big could that be in three to five years?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, Bruce, this is C.C. Wei again. No, we cannot disclose all the details on each segment. for example, CPU, GPU and AI accelerator, which one is more -- what kind of percentage.
In fact, they are all growing, but for the specific percentage, we don't comment right now.
Jeff Su
OK, Bruce?
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
I understand. Yes.
Jeff Su
OK. do you have a second question?
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Yes. The second question is regarding to the 28-nanometer, actually know that 28-nanometer is the biggest node among all the process node within TSMC, and which is suffer lower retention rate in 2018 and '19. So with the recent announcement in Nanjing or Japan or even in Gaozhou, it suggest another 16% of capacity growth in 28-nanometer alone in TSMC. Not to mention like your industry peer are all aggressively in expanding the 28-nanometer.
Can you provide like more like growth driver? And how can you feel comfortable to expand the capacity in this magnitude in the coming years when a lot of like financial industry we're talking about, like down cycle or a cycle peak or oversupply in 2023?
Jeff Su
OK. Bruce's second question is on 28-nanometer. He notes that we are, as C.C. said, expanding our capacity in 28-nanometer in various locations, but he also notes that other foundry peers in the industry are also expanding as well.
So he wants to know the risk, I guess, of oversupply.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, good question. As you pointed out in 2018, 2019, we have a lower utilization rate. It's just a little bit above 80%. But right now, we do observe that our long-term structural demand at 28-nanometer was to be well supported by multiple specialty technologies such as CMOS image sensor for multi-camera trend and better nonvolatile memory application and other specialty technologies.
To be in one word, actually, the enrichment in the silicon content in many end devices that develop in recent years helped to support this demand.
